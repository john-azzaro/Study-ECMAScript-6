## What is JavaScript Gallery Study?
The JavaScript Gallery study is an exploration of basic gallery strucuture for future reference. The gallery
itself has a main image on top (the focused image) and smaller images at the bottom (3+). Not really much to 
say about this project other than it is a matter of replacing the big screen and the previews on click.
